# **Gear Addict - API**

Gear Addict is an online application that allows users to add and categorise their music gear and also share details about their live rigs with the community. Users can interact with other users by becoming a fan, as well as liking, commenting and saving rigs.

This project was built as the final portfolio submission for the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) National Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. 

The project has been split into two parts - the front end built with [React](https://react.dev/), and the back end powered by the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). 

More information on the front end of the site can be found on the front end [README](https://github.com/Matthew-Hurrell/gear-addict/blob/main/README.md).

# User Stories

![Gear Addict User Story Example](static/readme-images/gear-addict-user-stories.png)

In terms of project management, user stories are an integral part of the software development creative process. There is a total of sixty user stories for the Gear Addict project. Before development began, all user stories began as epics. They were then refined down into user stories, which were then again split into acceptance criteria and tasks. Each user story was then assigned a story points number in relation to its difficulty in comparison to the other user stories. Finally, each user story was given a label to display its priority. User stories were then sorted into weekly iterations and added to the Gear Addict Project Board to aid with organisation. As development progressed, user stories were closed and moved into the done column on the Gear Addict project board. Each iteration was carefully planned to not have more than 60% must-have user stories. 

A full list of user stories can be found in a separate file here - [Gear Addict User Stories](https://github.com/Matthew-Hurrell/gear-addict/blob/main/readme/userstories.md)

# Database Schemas

![Gear Addict Database Schema](static/readme-images/gear-addict-database-schema.png)

The Gear Addict database was created using seven custom models. There are two different post types - Gear and Rigs. Users can also interact with the community using the Star, Like, Comment and Fan models. The enhanced profile model allows for further profile customisation to add to the user experience.
